# Octo-Do

A flexible to-do list built using a React.js frontend, Node.js backend and MySQL database

## The process
### Developed using
- React
- CSS
- Node.js
- Axios
- MySQL
- Heroku

### Inspirations and goals
My inspiration for Octo-Do came from the fact that I had a very specific way of organizing my to-do lists. Previously, I had used various alternatives including TickTick and Notion, but neither application provided the fuctionality I was looking for. Since I could not find the exact functionality I was looking for, I decided to learn and develop my own web application. 

### Designing and developing the application
