## The process
### Developed using

- CSS
- Node.js
- Axios
- MySQL
- Heroku

### Inspirations and goals
My inspiration for Octo-Do came from the fact that I had a very specific way of organizing my to-do lists. Previously, I had used various alternatives including TickTick and Notion, but neither application provided the fuctionality I was looking for. Since I could not find the exact functionality I was looking for, I decided to learn and develop my own web application. 

My goal for the web application was to eventually replace my current to-do list application as my daily driver. I wanted to have something that I could use for school, work and any other tasks I had in mind. There would be two sides to the application, an overall task side and a daily task side. In the overall tasks side, a user would be able to create, edit and delete any tasks they had. They would also be able to drag a task from the overall side to the daily tasks side to plan out what they wanted to do during the day.
